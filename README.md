Introduction to Python (10 minutes)
Python as compared to other languages
Basic Python constructs
Foundational Concepts of Machine Learning (10 minutes)
ML vs Statistics
Convergence over Iterations
Validating an ML model
Linear Regression, Logistic Regression to Neural Networks (10 minutes)
Linear Regression basics
Logistic Regression
Neural Networks (as an aggregation of logistic regression functions)
Example 1: Linear Regression using SkLearn (10 minutes)
This could be a simple example where we do some basic prediction using standard datasets such as the Iris flower dataset.
Example 2: A Simple Neural Network model using Keras (10 minutes)
This could be the same dataset above but demonstrated using Keras and a simple Neural Network
Example 3: Browser-based ML with tensorflow.js (10 minutes)
This could be the work that you had mentioned where you are introducing usage of tensorflow.js to perform ML in the browser.
