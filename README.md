<p>Introduction to Python (10 minutes)<br>
Python as compared to other languages<br>
Basic Python constructs . </p> 
<p>Foundational Concepts of Machine Learning (10 minutes)<br>
ML vs Statistics<br>
Convergence over Iterations<br>
Validating an ML model</p> 
<p>Linear Regression, Logistic Regression to Neural Networks (10 minutes)<br>
Linear Regression basics<br>
Logistic Regression<br>
Neural Networks (as an aggregation of logistic regression functions)</p> 
<p>Example 1: Linear Regression using SkLearn (10 minutes)<br>
This could be a simple example where we do some basic prediction using standard datasets such as the Iris flower dataset.</p> 
<p>Example 2: A Simple Neural Network model using Keras (10 minutes)<br>
This could be the same dataset above but demonstrated using Keras and a simple Neural Network</p> 
<p>Example 3: Browser-based ML with tensorflow.js (10 minutes)<br>
This could be the work that you had mentioned where you are introducing usage of tensorflow.js to perform ML in the browser.</p>
