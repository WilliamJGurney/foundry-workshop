<p>Using Jupyter Slides, maybe with the RISE plug-in, instead of powerpoint might be best for this, as the code will not be blurred, especially if you are screen sharing. See my Jupyter slides, and see if you agree? Sanjay, have you thought about how you will present? I could be the one to move your slides along? Or something more complex as trying to ssh into my running of the RISE jupyter slides??<p>

<p>1_Foundational Concepts of Machine Learning (5 minutes - WG)<br>
ML vs Statistics<br>
Convergence over Iterations<br>
Validating an ML model</p> 
<p>2_Linear Regression, Logistic Regression to Neural Networks (5 minutes)<br>
Linear Regression basics<br>
Logistic Regression<br>
Neural Networks (as an aggregation of logistic regression functions)</p> 
<p>3_Introduction to Python (5 minutes)<br>
Python as compared to other languages<br>
Basic Python constructs . </p> 
<p>4_Example 1: Logistic Regression Using Sklearn - Adult Data (10 minutes)<br>
This could be a simple example where we do some basic prediction using standard datasets such as the Iris flower dataset.</p> 
<p>5_Example 2: Simple Neural Network model using Keras - Adult Data (10 minutes)<br>
This could be the same dataset above but demonstrated using Keras and a simple Neural Network</p>
